# Diffusion Limited Aggregation Project

This MATLAB algorithm generates a diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) cluster in a 2-dimensional lattice, where particles are individually aggregated to a single cluster. Each particle is occupied at a radius slightly larger than the cluster radius and has a random initial direction. It then performs a random walk until it comes into proximity with the cluster and aggregates to it, initializing the next particle's trajectory.
